# Design Rationale

## Overview

SS_Lib was designed from the ground up to be a production-ready signal-slot library for C that can work in constrained environments while still providing features needed for complex applications.

## Design Goals

1. **Zero Dependencies**: Pure ANSI C with no external dependencies
2. **Embedded-Friendly**: Support for static memory allocation and ISR-safe operations
3. **Performance**: Minimal overhead for signal emission
4. **Flexibility**: Configurable features via compile-time flags
5. **Safety**: Thread-safe operations with optional mutex protection
6. **Simplicity**: Clean, intuitive API

## Architecture

### Memory Model

SS_Lib supports two memory models:

#### Dynamic Memory (Default)
- Uses standard malloc/free
- No predetermined limits
- Grows as needed
- Suitable for desktop/server applications

#### Static Memory
- Pre-allocated memory pool
- All allocations from fixed buffer
- No heap fragmentation
- Deterministic memory usage
- Perfect for embedded systems

### Data Structures

#### Signal Registry
- Hash table for O(1) signal lookup
- Linked list for collision resolution
- Configurable hash table size

#### Slot Lists
- Sorted by priority for deterministic execution order
- Doubly-linked for O(1) removal
- Connection handles map directly to nodes

### Thread Safety

When enabled, thread safety is implemented using:
- Single global mutex for simplicity
- Fine-grained locking considered but rejected for complexity
- Read-write locks evaluated but overhead too high for embedded
- Lock-free algorithms considered for future versions

### ISR Safety

ISR-safe mode provides:
- Lock-free emission path
- Pre-allocated emission buffers
- Deferred processing for complex operations
- Minimal ISR execution time

## Performance Considerations

### Signal Emission
- Direct function calls (no virtual dispatch)
- Cache-friendly memory layout
- Minimal indirection
- Priority sorting happens at connection time, not emission

### Memory Allocation
- Pool allocator for static mode
- Chunk-based allocation to reduce fragmentation
- Memory statistics for profiling

### String Handling
- Signal names use string interning
- Hash-based lookups avoid string comparisons
- Fixed-size names in static mode

## Trade-offs

### Simplicity vs Features
- Chose simple mutex over complex locking schemes
- Single signal registry over per-thread registries
- Direct callbacks over message queues

### Performance vs Safety
- Optional bounds checking
- Configurable debug assertions
- Statistics gathering can be disabled

### Flexibility vs Size
- Feature flags increase code complexity
- Single header option trades compilation time for ease of use
- Multiple API levels (basic vs extended)

## Comparison with Alternatives

### vs Qt Signals/Slots
- No code generation required
- Much smaller footprint
- C instead of C++
- Less type safety but more portable

### vs libsigc++
- Pure C implementation
- Static memory option
- Simpler API
- Better embedded support

### vs GObject
- No object system required
- Lighter weight
- Easier to integrate
- More focused scope

## Future Directions

### Version 3.0 Considerations
- Lock-free signal emission
- Type-safe signal definitions
- Coroutine support
- Network-transparent signals

### Potential Optimizations
- SIMD slot iteration
- Custom memory allocators
- JIT compilation for hot paths
- Hardware acceleration hooks

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
- Compile-time configuration
- Separation of core and optional features
- Clean API design
- Comprehensive test suite

### Challenges
- Balancing features with simplicity
- Supporting diverse use cases
- Maintaining ABI stability
- Documentation maintenance
